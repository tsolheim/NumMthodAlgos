# Simpson's Algorithm

##Definition:##
Simpson's Algorithm takes an input of x and y values that are evenly spaced apart along the x values.  
The MatLab function takes these values and utilizes a combination of a repetative Simpson's Composite Rule and Trapezoidal Rule given an odd number of intervals in order to estimate the integral of the function.

##**Input**##
x = [*list of x values with commas between*]
y = [*list of y values with commas between*]
Simpson(x,y)

##**Output**##
