# Simpson's Algorithm

** Definition:
Simpson's Algorithm takes an input of x and y values that are evenly spaced apart along the x values.  
The function takes these values and utilizes a combination of a repetative Simpson's Composite Rule and Trapezoidal Rule given an odd number of intervals in order to estimate the integral of the function.
