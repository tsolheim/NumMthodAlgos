# Numerical Method Algorithms

This is a set of algorithms that estimate the values of different mathematical phenomena on the scale of computers' capabilities.

The set of functions utilize the MatLab coding software in order to calculate and then display the values and functions.

## List of Functions 
* falsePosition = 
  * falsePosition(xl,xu,es,maxiter)
* luFactor      = Creates an Upper, Lower, and Pivoting Matrix for a Square Matrix (A).
  * luFactor(A)
* Simpson       = 
  * Simpson(x,y)
